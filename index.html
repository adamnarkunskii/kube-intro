1. What is Kubernetes?

# What is Kubernetes ⚓


### An open-source container-orchestration system 

--

### for automating deployment, scaling and management

--

### of containerized applications.


---

# What is Kubernetes ⚓

### Open-sourced by Google in 2014.

--


### On March 6, 2018 Kubernetes Project reached ninth place in commits at Github, and second place in authors and issues, just below Linux Project.

--


### The name originates from Greek, meaning 'Captain' or 'Helmsman'. K8s is just an abbreviation.

---


# What can it do? 

### Kubernetes provides a container-centric management environment. 

--

### It orchestrates computing, networking, and storage infrastructure on behalf of user workloads.

--

### Facilitates declarative configuration and automation.

--

### It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem.

---

# What Kubernetes is _Not_

#### Kubernetes is not a mere orchestration system. In fact, it eliminates the need for orchestration.

--

#### The technical definition of orchestration is execution of a defined workflow: first do A, then B, then C. 

--

### In contrast, Kubernetes is comprised of a set of independent, composable control processes that continuously drive the current state towards the provided desired state.

--

#### It shouldn’t matter how you get from A to C. Centralized control is also not required. 

--

#### This results in a system that is easier to use and more powerful, robust, resilient, and extensible.

# Containers 🐳

A container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes *everything* needed to run an application: 

--

- code,

--

- runtime,

--

- system libraries,

--

-  and settings.

---

# Containers 🐳

.center[The most widespread and de-facto standard container runtime is

# DOCKER

but that's for another talk.]
