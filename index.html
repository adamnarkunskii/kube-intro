# What is Kubernetes ⚓


### An open-source container-orchestration system 

--

### for automating deployment, scaling and management

--

### of containerized applications.

🐾

---

# What is Kubernetes ⚓

### Open-sourced by Google in 2014.

--


### On March 6, 2018 Kubernetes Project reached ninth place in commits at Github, and second place in authors and issues, just below Linux Project.

--


### The name originates from Greek, meaning 'Captain' or 'Helmsman'. K8s is just an abbreviation.

🐾

---


# What can it do? 

### Kubernetes provides a container-centric management environment. 

--

### It orchestrates computing, networking, and storage infrastructure on behalf of user workloads.

--

### Facilitates declarative configuration and automation.

--

### It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem.

🐾

---

# What Kubernetes is _Not_

#### Kubernetes is not a mere orchestration system. In fact, it eliminates the need for orchestration.

--

#### The technical definition of orchestration is execution of a defined workflow: first do A, then B, then C. 

--

### In contrast, Kubernetes is comprised of a set of independent, composable control processes that continuously drive the current state towards the provided desired state.

--

#### It shouldn’t matter how you get from A to C. Centralized control is also not required. 

--

#### This results in a system that is easier to use and more powerful, robust, resilient, and extensible.

# Containers 🐳

A container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes *everything* needed to run an application: 

--

- code,

--

- runtime,

--

- system libraries,

--

-  and settings.

# Containers 🐳

.center[The most widespread and de-facto standard container runtime is

# DOCKER

but that's for another talk.]

# Kubernetes Concepts

--

- Pods 🤖

--

- Controllers 👮‍♀️

--

  - Deployments 🏪

  - Jobs (run to completion) 🎟

  - ...

--

- Services ⛩

--

- Configuration, Networking, Ingress, ... 

🐾

---

# Pods 🤖

--

#### The _Pod_ is the basic building block of Kubernetes.

--

#### The smallest deployable object.

--

#### Represents a running process in your cluster.

--

#### Encapsulates storage and network resources, and options that govern how the container(s) should run.

--

#### A pod can run a single container,

--

#### Or run multiple containers that work together.


🐾

# Pods 🤖

---

# Pods 🤖

--

#### Pods simplify application deployment and management by providing a higher-level abstraction than the set of their constituent applications.

--

#### Pods serve as unit of deployment, horizontal scaling, and replication.

--

#### These handled automatically for containers in a pod:

--

- Colocation (co-scheduling), 

--

- shared fate (e.g. termination), 

--

- coordinated replication, 

--

- resource sharing, 

--

- and dependency management

🐾

---

# Controllers 👮‍♀️

#### A controller is a reconciliation loop that drives actual cluster state toward the desired cluster state.

--

#### For example, a _Replication Controller_, handles replication and scaling by running a specified number of copies of a pod across the cluster.

--

#### A _Job Controller_ creates one or more pods and ensures that a specified number of them successfully terminate.

--

#### Other kinds of controllers include  _Deployment_, _Node Controller_, and _DaemonSet_.

🐾

---

# Services ⛩


#### Kubernetes Pods are mortal. They are born and when they die, they are not resurrected.

--

#### While each Pod gets its own IP address, even those IP addresses cannot be relied upon to be stable over time.

--

#### Then how pods can keep communicating with each other over time?

🐾

---

# Services ⛩

### A Kubernetes Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods, and the means to access them.
