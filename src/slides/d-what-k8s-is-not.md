# What Kubernetes is _Not_

#### Kubernetes is not a mere orchestration system. In fact, it eliminates the need for orchestration.

--

#### The technical definition of orchestration is execution of a defined workflow: first do A, then B, then C. 

--

### In contrast, Kubernetes is comprised of a set of independent, composable control processes that continuously drive the current state towards the provided desired state.

--

#### It shouldn’t matter how you get from A to C. Centralized control is also not required. 

--

#### This results in a system that is easier to use and more powerful, robust, resilient, and extensible.
